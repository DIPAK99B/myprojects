how human thinking works 
can a machine have dreams?
how to create a machine which can think like human
to create a AI first we fully need to understand how human works
how humans think how human function 
we are at this stage now that we are not capable of making AI for now 
just like to build something we need resources we need hardware 
for now humans are working on slowly slowly they are moving forward to AI 
by creating things which AI need, 
like image recognition , speach recognition its just complex things but for AI its just basics 
the complex things which we need to work on is how we are going to teah a machine which can learn by
its self how it is going to work its very complex ,
AI is just like a baby we can teah him how to talk how walk and do things but how we are 
going to create a complex thinking and working machine which has its own brain which is not just a machine
which can think?
i am really curious about how that's gonna happend.
to build PURE AI we need more info about our self
